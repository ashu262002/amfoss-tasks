# Introspection

### 1. Why must we choose you ?
I beleive that a club is a place where like minded people meet and try to come up with something which is useful for the society and also self development, i want to pursue my passion of computers and coding and would like to grab more opportunities through the platform of AmFOSS.
 I genuinely love computers, since i was a kid i would unscrew and detach every part of my pc and study about it. I love learning about computers and hardware, creating 
something off nothing gives me a great amount of satisfaction. I am a kind of guy who is open to criticism and is ready to work upon the shortcomings so as to become a good coder.
I have a lot of shortcomings which i expect i can bridge the gaps  and overcome them by joining amfoss, though i know a bit or two about hardware and some python syntax i dont know much about coding and software
development , also which i expect to overcome. I am not very socially open person which i think can be overcomed by meeting different multifaceted people.

### 2. What is your plan for the next 6 months ?
My target for the net 6 months is to improve upon my coding skills and upskill myself by participating in coding websites such as Hackerrank or codeforces , also i wil be preparing for GSOC.
I will be maintaining my studies so as to get a good GPA and not upset my parents :-)

### 3. How would you contribute back to the club ?
I would try to impart my knowledge to people and help them out with whatever i know , i will try to be a better coder and participate in different coding competitions and take amfoss
on an international stage. In the coming years i would try to recruit quality people for the club.

### 4. Do you have any feedback for the selection process ?
Well honestly i do like the selection process because, a guy like me who is from a non-CS background with no prior experience in coding, you guys made the selection process fair and square by not getting
biased for requiring coding experience, because many of us come from different schools where computer science is not available or that much of digital awareness is not present among people.
Tasks are such that it will require some problem skills and only necessary beginner level of coding which most people can maybe handle. That's it from my side :-)
